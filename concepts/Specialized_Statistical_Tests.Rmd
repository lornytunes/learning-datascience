## Normal

```{r plot_normal_theoretical}
df_norm <- tibble(
    x = seq(from = -5, to = 5, length.out = 100)
) %>% mutate(y = dnorm(x))

df_norm %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_line()
```

```{r plot_normal_empirical}

ggplot(tibble(u = rnorm(1000)), aes(x = u)) +
    geom_density() +
    geom_line(data = df_norm, aes(x = x, y = y), linetype = 'dashed')

```


```{r normal_cdf}
# 50% of the observations will be less than the mean
pnorm(0)
# 2.3% of all observations are more than 2 standard deviations below the mean
pnorm(-2)
# and 95.4% are 2 sd from te mean
pnorm(2) - pnorm(-2)
```

The function `qnorm(p, mean = m, sd = s)` is the quantile function for the normal distribution with mean m and standard deviation s. Itâ€™s the inverse of `pnorm()`, in that `qnorm(p, mean = m, sd = s)` returns the value x such that `pnorm(x, mean = m, sd = s) == p`.


```{r using_qnorm}
# the median is also the mean
qnorm(0.5)
# 75th percentile
(line <- qnorm(0.75))
pnorm(line)
xstr <- sprintf("qnorm(0.75) = %1.3f", line)
# normal distribution to the left of the 75th percentile
df75 <- df_norm %>% 
    filter(x < line)

ggplot(df_norm, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_area(data = df75, aes(x = x, y = y), fill = 'grey') +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = line), linetype = 'dashed') +
    geom_text(x = line, y = 0, label = xstr, vjust = 1)

```

## Lognormal

```{r log_normal_properties}
# 1001 samples from lognormal with meanlog 0 and sdlog 1
df_u <- tibble(u = rlnorm(1001))
# mean higher than median
df_u %>% 
    summarise(
        mean = mean(u),
        median = median(u),
        # mean of log(u) is approx 0
        mean_l = mean(log(u)),
        # sd of log(u) is approx 1
        sd_l = sd(log(u))
    )
# mean is higher than the median
df_lnorm <- tibble(
    x = seq(from  = 0, to = 25, length.out = 500)
) %>% mutate(y = dlnorm(x))

df_norm <- tibble(
    x = seq(from = -5, to = 5, length.out = 500)
) %>% mutate(y = dnorm(x))

ggplot(df_u, aes(x = u)) +
    geom_density() +
    geom_line(data = df_lnorm, aes(x = x, y = y), linetype = 2)

ggplot(df_u, aes(x = log(u))) +
    geom_density() +
    geom_line(data = df_norm, aes(x = x, y = y), linetype = 2)

```

## Correlation

```{r synthetic_uncorrelated_income}
set.seed(235236)
income <- tibble(
    EarnedIncome = 100000 * rlnorm(100),
    CapitalGains = 100000 * rlnorm(100)
)
with(income, cor(EarnedIncome, CapitalGains))

```

```{r test_the_correlation}
income %>% 
    summarise(cor = cor(EarnedIncome, CapitalGains, method = 'spearman'))
ctest <- with(income, cor.test(EarnedIncome, CapitalGains, method = 'spearman'))
broom::tidy(ctest)
```

```{r cor_test_sigr}
sigr::wrapCorTest(ctest)
```
